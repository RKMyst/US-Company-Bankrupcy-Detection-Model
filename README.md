# US-Company-Bankrupcy-Detection-Model

Introduction
In the dynamic and ever-changing world of financial markets, the ability to identify early signs of trouble and
properly forecast possible bankruptcies is critical for investors, analysts, and businesses alike. This study aims to
improve the accuracy of bankruptcy prediction by leveraging cutting-edge deep learning algorithms. Our focus
extends to addressing the complex issues provided by the diverse forces that shape the dynamic financial industry.
Among the constant evolution of the financial world, the ability to foresee bankruptcy emerges as an essential skill.
Our study strategically uses modern machine learning approaches to predict impending bankruptcies in publicly
traded corporations in the United States. Our overarching goal is to equip stakeholders with a sophisticated tool that
will improve risk management methods and enable nuanced strategic decision-making. This study methodically
recounts our journey from problem discovery to the building of a strong predictive model, demonstrating deep
learning's potential to provide novel solutions to traditional financial challenges.

Problem Statement
Bridging the Gap in Bankruptcy Prediction Through Advanced Deep Learning
Navigating the intricate landscape of financial markets poses an intricate challenge in accurately predicting
impending bankruptcies. The existing methodologies employed for projecting bankruptcy in US public corporations
exhibit a notable lack of accuracy, creating a void that hinders stakeholders and investors from making well-
informed decisions. This glaring disparity underscores the pressing need for an intelligent, machine learning-based
solution capable of augmenting predictive capabilities and facilitating effective risk management strategies.
Traditional approaches to bankruptcy prediction often prove inadequate, falling short in precision when confronted
with the complexities of evolving financial scenarios. Recognizing these inherent limitations, this research
endeavors to bridge the gap by leveraging advanced deep learning algorithms. The overarching objective is to craft
a robust bankruptcy prediction model that not only overcomes the shortcomings of traditional techniques but also
introduces a new paradigm in predictive analytics within the financial domain. Through the integration of
sophisticated machine learning methodologies, this work aspires to reshape the landscape of bankruptcy prediction,
offering stakeholders and investors a more reliable and accurate tool for navigating the challenges of financial
uncertainty.

Motivation
Value or Cost of the Damage Incurred in the Enron Scandal
Consider Enron Corporation, a once-global energy behemoth that went bankrupt in 2001 because of severe
accounting fraud and financial mismanagement. The Enron disaster, which had a stunning original value of $70
billion in 2001, serves as a harsh reminder of the dangers of financial mismanagement and the limitations of
conventional assessments.

If we want to adjust the value of $70 billion in 2001 to its equivalent in 2024, you need to consider the impact of
inflation over the years. The formula for adjusting for inflation is:
Adjusted Value=Nominal Value√ó [(1+Inflation Rate) ^n]
Where:
- Adjusted Value is the value in 2024,
- Nominal Value is the value in 2001 ($70 billion),
- Inflation Rate is the average annual inflation rate, and
- n is the number of years between 2001 and 2024.
Assuming an average annual inflation rate of 2%, and n = 2024 - 2001 = 23 years:
Adjusted Value = 70,000,000,000 x [(1 + 0.02) ^ 23]
Adjusted Value = 107,926,267,800.59
Therefore, with an average annual inflation rate of 2%, adjusting the nominal value of $70 billion in 2001 yields an
estimated equivalent value of approximately $107.93 billion in 2024, accounting for the impact of inflation on
purchasing power. In the context of this historical scenario, the adjusted value in 2024 is expected to be $107 billion,
underscoring the importance of utilizing advanced prediction models, like deep learning, to identify early indicators
of financial distress and mitigate risks associated with high-stakes financial decisions. This report chronicles our
journey from problem identification to the development of a robust prediction model, drawing insights from
historical events such as Enron to showcase the revolutionary potential of advanced machine learning in
transforming traditional approaches to financial forecasting.
The Enron scandal, a watershed moment in corporate history, serves as a compelling motivation for the development
and implementation of advanced predictive models, particularly in the realm of bankruptcy prediction. The
extensive damage incurred during the Enron debacle highlights the far-reaching consequences of financial
mismanagement and underscores the need for robust risk mitigation strategies.
1) Market Capitalization Loss
Enron's market capitalization, which peaked at over $70 billion, plummeted rapidly. By the time of its
bankruptcy filing in December 2001, the market capitalization had dwindled to almost zero. The colossal loss
in market value is a stark reminder of the devastating impact on shareholder wealth and market integrity.
2) Investor Losses
Shareholders experienced substantial losses as Enron's stock price collapsed. Estimates suggest that investors
incurred tens of billions of dollars in losses, underscoring the importance of early detection mechanisms to
safeguard investor interests.
3) Employee Impact
Enron's employees not only lost their jobs but also suffered significant financial setbacks, particularly in their
retirement savings heavily invested in Enron stock. Employee losses, including pension and 401(k) plan
reductions, amounted to billions of dollars, highlighting the human impact of financial scandals.
4) Legal and Regulatory Consequences
Enron faced a barrage of lawsuits, investigations, and settlements. The legal and regulatory costs associated
with the scandal, including fines and penalties, ran into hundreds of millions of dollars. The profound legal

repercussions underscore the importance of proactive risk management to avoid entanglement in costly legal
battles.
5) Collapse of Arthur Andersen
The fallout from the Enron scandal extended to its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, leading to its collapse.
The dissolution of Arthur Andersen had widespread financial ramifications, affecting not only the firm but
also its stakeholders. This emphasizes the interconnectedness of entities within the financial ecosystem.
6) Broader Economic Impact
The Enron scandal reverberated beyond the corporate realm, impacting broader economic dynamics. The
erosion of investor confidence, changes in regulatory practices, and shifts in corporate governance standards
had ripple effects throughout the economy, emphasizing the interconnected nature of financial markets.
7) Total Financial Fallout
While it's challenging to quantify the exact total financial fallout, the combined impact of market
capitalization loss, investor losses, legal costs, and other consequences likely amounted to tens of billions of
dollars. This comprehensive assessment highlights the multifaceted nature of financial damage incurred
during the Enron scandal.
Given the numerous and extensive consequences of the Enron scandal, the motivation for building improved
prediction models becomes clear. These models, particularly those based on deep learning, seek to function as
proactive instruments for detecting early indicators of financial trouble, mitigating risks, and protecting the financial
well-being of investors, employees, and the greater economy.
